This is the repository for the CriticalArc .net SDK. This SDK is provided to organisations that have a commerical agreement with CriticalArc to integrate with our realtime safety and security platform, SafeZone.

Here you can find code samples and documentation (still a work in progress), as well as raise issues directly with the development team.

The SDK itself is provided as a NuGet package, available at: https://www.nuget.org/packages/CriticalArc.Sdk
