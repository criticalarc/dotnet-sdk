Last Update: October 2016

CRITICALARC LICENSE TERMS

CRITICALARC SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT KIT (SDK)

These license terms are between You ("You") and CriticalArc Pty Ltd ("CriticalArc") regarding Your use of the
CriticalArc Software Development Kit and any associated documentation, software code or other materials made available
by CriticalArc (collectively referred to in this agreement as the "SDK"). The terms also apply to documentation for the
SDK and any software code provided by CriticalArc in conjunction with such documentation. The SDK is made available by
CriticalArc to assist developers in integrating certain functionality of CriticalArc’s Services, known as "SafeZone".
This license applies to any SDK that includes, displays or links to this license, and to any updates, supplements or
support services for this SDK, unless other terms accompany those items. If so, those other terms apply.

BY INSTALLING, ACCESSING OR OTHERWISE USING THE SDK, YOU ACCEPT THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT AND CONSENT TO THE
TRANSMISSION OF CERTAIN COMPUTER INFORMATION DURING USE AND FOR INTERNET-BASED SERVICES. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE
TERMS OF THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT, DO NOT INSTALL, ACCESS OR USE THE SDK.

If You comply with these license terms, you have the rights below.

INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS.

1.  Installation and Use. You may install and use any number of copies of the SDK on your devices to design, develop
    and test your programs. Each copy must be complete, including all copyright and trademark notices. You must require
    end users to agree to terms of use that protect the SDK as much as these License terms.
2.  Subject to Your compliance with this license, You may use the SDK solely for the purpose of creating
    "Authorized Applications" which for the purpose of this license are applications, such as (a) web or client-based
    application, in object code form, or (b) those portions of your gateway server ("server interfaces"), that are
    designed to provide access to the CriticalArc Services, and that (i) You make available for download (e.g., via
    Your website or an application store), (ii) You make accessible through Your web interface or service, or (iii) You
    pre-install and embed on your device(s). You are not authorized to pre-install or embed applications created using
    this SDK on third-party devices. You may reproduce the SDK, provided that You reproduce only complete copies,
    including without limitation all "read me" files, copyright notices, and other legal notices and terms that
    CriticalArc has included in the SDK, and provided that You may not distribute any copy You make of the SDK.
3.  DISTRIBUTABLE CODE. Unless otherwise provided, if the SDK contains other CriticalArc programs, these license terms
    apply to your use of those programs. The SDK contains code in source and object form that you are permitted to
    include in Authorized Applications if You comply with the terms below.
    a. Right to Use and Distribute. The code and text files listed below are "Distributable Code."
     1.) Sample Code. You may modify, copy, and distribute the source code form of code marked as "sample" in the SDK.
     2.) Redistribution. You may permit distributors of Your Authorized Applications to copy and distribute the
         Distributable Code as part of those applications.
    b. Distribution Requirements. For any Distributable Code that You distribute, You must
     1.) require distributors and external end users to agree to terms that protect it at least as much as this license;
         and
     2.) indemnify, defend, and hold harmless CriticalArc from any claims, including attorneys’ fees, related to the
         distribution or use of Your Authorized Applications.
    c. Distribution Restrictions. You may not
     1.) alter any copyright, trademark or patent notice in the Distributable Code;
     2.) use CriticalArc’s trademarks in Your applications’ names or in a way that suggests Your applications come from
         or are endorsed by CriticalArc;
     3.) include Distributable Code in malicious, deceptive or unlawful applications; or
     4.) modify, distribute or convey any Distributable Code so that the Distributable Code or any application to which
         it links, or of which it is a part, becomes subject to an Excluded License. An Excluded License is one that
         requires, as a condition of license, use, modification, distribution or conveyance, that
      a) the code be disclosed or distributed in source code form;
      b) others have the right to modify or create derivative works of it; and/or
      c) it becomes redistributable at no charge.
4.  BETA-RELEASE PREVIEWS. The following additional terms apply to any SDK where it may be offered by CriticalArc as
    part of a Beta-Release Preview program
    a.  PRE-RELEASE VERSION. This SDK is a pre-release version. It may not operate correctly or work the way a final
        version of the SDK will. CriticalArc may change it for the final, commercial version. We also may not release a
        commercial version. IF YOU DECIDE TO MAKE USE OF ANY OF THE RIGHTS UNDER THIS LICENSE YOU AGREE THAT IT IS AT YOUR
        SOLE DISCRETION AND YOU ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR AND RISK OF ANY AND ALL DAMAGES THAT MAY RESULT FROM OR IN
        CONNECTION WITH THE SDK, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE UNAVAILABILITY OR INTERRUPTION OF OPERATIONS OR THE LOSS
        OF ANY DATA OR OTHER CONTENT.
    b.  Development and Testing Use. If you comply with the rest of these license terms, you may use the SDK to design,
        develop and test Authorized Applications. You may not distribute the Authorized Application or any Distributable
        Code in a live production environment unless expressly permitted by CriticalArc.
5.  INTERNET-BASED SERVICES. CriticalArc provides Internet-based services with the SDK. It may change or cancel them at
    any time. You may not use this SDK or the CriticalArc Services in any way that could harm the CriticalArc Services
    or impair anyone else’s use of it. You may not use the SDK or the CriticalArc Service to try to gain unauthorized
    access to any service, data, account or network by any means. Some SDK features connect to CriticalArc computer
    systems over the Internet. In some cases, you will not receive a separate notice when they connect. By using this
    SDK, you consent to the transmission of this information.
6.  ICON LICENSE. Subject to Your compliance with the terms of this license, CriticalArc grants You a non-exclusive,
    non-transferable, worldwide, revocable right to use the icons identified in the SDK documentation. All rights not
    expressly granted herein are reserved by CriticalArc. The right to use the Icons as granted herein in no way
    implies or grants You any rights to distribute any CriticalArc products or other intellectual property.
a.  No Sublicensing. You are granted no sublicense right and shall not purport to permit any third party to use the
    Icons in any manner without CriticalArc’s prior written consent.
b.  No Use for Merchandising. Your right to use the Icons in connection with Authorized Applications shall not extend
    to the merchandising or sale of related or promotional products under the Icons.
c.  Prohibited Activities. You shall not use the Icons in connection with any activity that (a) disparages CriticalArc
    or its products or services; (b) violates or infringes any intellectual property of CriticalArc; or (c) violates
    any local, state, federal, country, or international regulation or law.
7.  SCOPE OF LICENSES. The SDK is licensed, not sold. This license only gives You some rights to use the SDK.
    CriticalArc reserves all other rights. Unless applicable law gives You more rights despite this limitation, You may
    use the SDK only as expressly permitted in this license. In doing so, You must comply with any technical
    limitations in the SDK that only allow You to use it in certain ways. You may not:
    a. work around any technical limitations in the SDK;
    b. reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the SDK, except and only to the extent that applicable law expressly
       permits, despite this limitation;
    c. make more copies of the SDK than specified in this license or allowed by, except and only to the extent
       applicable law expressly permits, despite this limitation; or
    d. publish the SDK for others to copy.
8.  USE OF THE SERVICES. Your use of the CriticalArc Services, and the use of the CriticalArc Services by anyone
    hosting or using your Authorized Application, is governed by the then-current SafeZone Security System Agreement
    (SSSA). If any SDK for which You are granted rights hereunder makes use of the CriticalArc Services (as governed
    by the applicable SSSA), then those SDK rights are granted subject to your compliance with the applicable SSSA.
9.  SUPPORT. CriticalArc is not obligated to provide any technical or other support ("Support Services") for the SDK or
    CriticalArc Services to You. However, if CriticalArc chooses to provide any Support Services to You, Your use of
    such Support Services will be governed by then-current CriticalArc policies. With respect to any technical or other
    information You provide to CriticalArc in connection with the Support Services, You agree that CriticalArc has an
    unrestricted right to use such information for its business purposes, including for product support and
    development. CriticalArc will not use such information in a form that personally identifies You.
10. TERMINATION. CriticalArc reserves the right to discontinue offering the SDK and CriticalArc Services or to modify
    the SDK or CriticalArc Services at any time in its sole discretion. If You are dissatisfied with any aspect of the
    SDK or CriticalArc Services at any time, Your sole and exclusive remedy is to cease using them. Notwithstanding
    anything contained in the license to the contrary, CriticalArc may also, in its sole discretion, terminate or
    suspend access to the SDK and CriticalArc Services to You or any end user at any time. You acknowledge that
    termination and/or monetary damages may not be a sufficient remedy if You breach this license and that CriticalArc
    will be entitled, without waiving any other rights or remedies, to injunctive or equitable relief as may be deemed
    proper by a court of competent jurisdiction in the event of a breach. This Section and Sections 10, 11, 13, 14, 15
    and 16 will survive termination of this license or any discontinuation of the offering of the SDK or CriticalArc
    Services, along with any other provisions that would reasonably be deemed to survive such events.
11. RESERVATION OF RIGHTS. Except for the licenses expressly granted under this license, CriticalArc and its suppliers
    retain all right, title and interest in and to the SDK, CriticalArc Services, and all intellectual property rights
    therein. You are not authorized to alter, modify, copy, edit, format, create derivative works of or otherwise use
    any materials, content or technology provided under this license except as explicitly provided in this license or
    approved in advance in writing by CriticalArc.
12. MODIFICATIONS; NOTICES. If we change this contract, then we will give you notice before the change is in force. If
    you do not agree to these changes, then you must cancel and stop using the SDK, CriticalArc Services before the
    changes are in force. If you do not stop using the SDK, CriticalArc Services, then your use of the SDK, CriticalArc
    Services will continue under the changed contract. CriticalArc may give notices to You, at CriticalArc's option, by
    electronic mail to any e-mail address provided by You to CriticalArc.
13. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This license and the SafeZone Security System Agreement (SSSA), are the entire agreement with
    respect to the SDK and the CriticalArc Services.
14. APPLICABLE LAW. This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of
    New South Wales (Australia).
15. LEGAL EFFECT. This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights under the laws of Your
    country. This agreement does not change Your rights under the laws of Your country if the laws of Your country do
    not permit it to do so.
16. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. The SDK is licensed "as-is." You bear the risk of using it. CriticalArc gives no express or
    implied warranties, guarantees or conditions. You may have additional consumer rights under Your local laws which
    this agreement cannot change. To the extent permitted under Your local laws, CriticalArc excludes the implied
    warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement. 
17. LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF REMEDIES AND DAMAGES. You can recover from CriticalArc and its suppliers only direct
    damages up to U.S. $5.00. You cannot recover any other damages, including consequential, lost profits, special,
    indirect or incidental damages. 
    This limitation applies to 
    a. anything related to the SDK, CriticalArc Services, content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or
       third party programs; and 
    b. claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or
       other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law. 
    It applies even if CriticalArc knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. The above limitation
    or exclusion may not apply to You because Your country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental,
    consequential or other damages.
